      "description": "This project has been designed to detect lanes based on machine learning built using machine learning CNN, Python, Keras, NumPy, Tensorflow.\n\n- Created a semantic segmentation model that takes an image as an input, and provides us output, a category classification for every pixel. It uses computer vision\n- Ideated and developed a model which perfectly worked with offline test data set with 99% accuracy, thereby eliminating scalability issues.\n- It uses a CNN which consists of an encoder and decoder network.\n- Encoder is the part of the algorithm network structure to extract image features.\n- Decoder: This layer is widely used for the pixel-wise classification task where the feature maps have to be restored to original input image size. Its aim is to up-sample the image to get the same resolution as the input image.\n- The final deconvolution layer ends with one filter, as the image is returned image in the ‘G' color channel, as we want the predicted lanes to be in green.\n- The accuracy was 99% with each epoch where IOU of road pixels had high class score and helps to detect a trajectory that is safe and efficient."

      "description": "This project has been designed to detect vehicles based on machine learning built using HOG, Python, Keras, NumPy, Tensorflow and SVM.\n\n- Built a model in python which uses Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labelled training set of images.\n- It Trains a Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.\n- It Implements a sliding-window technique and uses the trained SVM classifier to search for vehicles in images.\n- The model runs the pipeline on a video stream and creates a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follows detected vehicles.\n- We finally estimate a bounding box for vehicles which are detected.\n- Implemented multiprocessing and python libraries to solve scalability challenges and provides a better frame rate of average 5.5 fps which is far better than the cv model.\n- The model was able to detect vehicles with 99.26% efficiency."

      "description": "Designed a simulation model of self driving system using imitation learning policy “Behavioral Cloning ,python and PyTorch\n\n- Using behavioral cloning, we give raw sensor data as input to train our network.\n- The model learns to imitate the actions of the expert system.\n- The output of the network is the driving policy, represented by desired steering angle and/or acceleration or breaking.\n- To build the training dataset, we collected about 72 hours of real-world driving videos.\n- During the evaluation, the car was able to drive itself with accuracy of 98%."
