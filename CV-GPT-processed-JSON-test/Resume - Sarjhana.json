Tested counterfactual understanding of churn data and performed clustering for customer segmentation to help Fortune 500 companies diagnose and reduce customer churn rate resulting in a 20% increase in revenue. Authored optimal codes to effectively formulate Model Stability using Population Stability Index (PSI) and Characteristic Stability Index (CSI). Acted as a single point of communication between the intern team and management team to engineer the new features and integrate them into the existing product. Built LSTM, CNN, NN, and BERT models to test various explainability libraries like SHAP, LIME, and ex-BERT using TensorFlow and Huggingface."
