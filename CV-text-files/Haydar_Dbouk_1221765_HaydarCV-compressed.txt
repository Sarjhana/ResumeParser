I live each day with a set goal of doing at 
least one good deed a day. Big or small, an 
act of kindness is impactful, costs nothing, 
and is a step closer to change. I'm at my 
best and thrive the most when I am 
contributing to someone else's growth, and 
their mental and physical prosperity. Being 
in a position where I can help others is a 
constant blessing I am grateful for, and a 
blessing to put to use.

hooks, understanding the purpose of each and applying 
them to ensure the distribution of my imagined film.

prized possession. Still I Rise is a 15-minute documentary
