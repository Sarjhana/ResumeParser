PROJECT WORK
Seismic Analysis & Design of (G+3) Building by using ETABS and STAAD.Pro
Description: The objective of our project is to conduct complete seismic analysis and designing
of the main structural elements of multi-storey building such as Slabs, Beams, and Columns. The
various structural elements of multi-storey building need to be designed taking the strength and
stability factors into consideration. The building was designed by considering dead load and live
load according to standards and by considering seismic force to ensure the safety and keeping
careful balance between economy and safety. Structural members of the project analyzed and
designed by using the software’s like STAAD.Pro and E-Tabs. The building should sustain all the
loads and deformation of normal construction and have adequate desirability and resistance to
the effects of seismic force.
