Design to me is something that strikes a chord in 
people's heart! As a little girl I was passionate 
about exploring colours and did a lot of mandala 
paintings in my slack time. This has taught me to 
use colours appropriately, develop attention to 
detail and mature in to a passionate design 
professional with a keenness to explore and learn.
