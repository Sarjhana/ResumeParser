
I am performing data cleaning and analysis on unstructured
data in the NER medical field, using PDF s, images, OCR,
and Docano to improve model training."

I have completed the task of performing OCR analysis and
PDF analysis to optimize the costing and billing processes.

I contributed to the API integration in Flask.

I created a Tesseract OCR API as an alternative to Google
OCR, which can be expensive. This API can be used to
extract text from images and PDF s more affordably

I refactored the code to optimize for faster execution. By
streamlining the code and removing unnecessary steps, we
were able to significantly reduce processing times and
improve the overall efficiency of the application.

I highlighted the disease names that were extracted from
the PDFs. By using an algorithm to identify disease-related
terms, we were able to automatically highlight relevant
information and make it easier for researchers to quickly
scan through the documents.

"I scraped valuable data that can
be used by the data team for
future analysis and decision-
making."
