SHUBHAM
KADAM
SOCIAL MEDIA MANAGER.
If I was a movie that you were to watch then
consider this as a trailer, I really like to work
smart and I consider myself as a creative
person. And in this century nothing is better
than social media to show that. I am currently
running a Food&Travel page of my own on
Instagram (jashnn_e_zindagii) which was
founded in April 2022. And if I'd like to
conclude that, I can say, 'I like to live it out'
