I am a technological enthusiast with the capacity to learn new skills, and
since I am familiar with the fundamentals of programming languages and
algorithms, I am able to work both in front- and back-end roles.
My abilities and professional development have
grown while working in a tough environment.
Programming languages including C, C++, Data
Structure, Java, Oracle, Database Management with
SQL,PLSQL, and MySQL are among those I've
learned.
I gained knowledge of leadership traits and
communication abilities.
