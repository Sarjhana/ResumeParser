MINI PROJECTS: 
1. PANIC ALARM 
In this project, I will show how to design and build a simple panic alarm circuit using 555 
Timer IC and a few other easily available components. This can used to activate an alarm in case of 
any emergencies. 
There can be any sudden situation of panic. It could be because of an intruder entering our house or 
bad health status. Situations can be many for panicking and may vary from person to person. 
During such emergencies, we might be unable to intimate to the people around us. At that time we 
use Panic alarm. 
 
 
 
2. CONVERSION OF SOUND ENERGY TO ELECTICAL VOLATGE. 
This can be done by using a transducer by converting vibrations caused by noise into 
electrical energy. The vibrations created by the noise can be converted into electrical 
energy through the principle of electromagnetic induction. The demonstrated ideas probe 
into a clean and readily available source of energy. 
3. RC SUBMARINE. 
 
          Nowadays, RC (radio control) submarine canbe used to do underwater monitoring. In this 
project, the costwill be optimum and using an easy to obtain parts. The mainthings in the RC 
submarine are controller system andwatertight. The important components in the controllercircuit are 
ESC and radio control module and propellermotor. For direction control servo motor is used to 
controlsurface unit. The ballast tank is made from PVC (poly vinylchloride) pipes, sockets and round 
shape. To make a controlsystem for the ballast system is the tough challenge in thisproject. The circuit 
is sensitive and easy to malfunctions. Thesubmarine can be controlled by using remote control 
deviceand can broadcast underwater scene using on board wirelesscamera.

    INTERNSHIP: 
 
I have perused my intern at ARDC, HAL Bangalore. It was good experience at HAL by learning lot of 
things on aircrafts, testing of aircrafts. I had experience by learning software such as AutoCAD, 
CATIA etc. I visited lab of LCA aircraft and learned some of testing such as NTT testing of LCA 
aircraft. I had good experience and had intern upto 1 month at HAL.
