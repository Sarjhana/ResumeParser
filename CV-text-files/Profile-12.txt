Some project highlights as Data Science Specialist at Deloitte
Determine Up-sell Probability for Existing Customers (Tensorflow PoC)
Developed a custom Tensorflow Estimator (python) deployed on Google Cloud
ML Engine to predict up-sell opportunity for a bank. The effectiveness of using
a custom Tensorflow Estimator API was assessed against a traditional logistic
regression model. (Google Cloud ML Engine, Tensorflow)
Attribution Modeling for Call Center Metrics
Established key relationships between customer experience metrics and
bottom line of a telecom major by using multivariate linear and non linear
regression models that providing better control on metrics for key business
stakeholders; Python – sklearn, pandas, statsmodels
Customer Segmentation and Profile Generation
Created an unsupervised patient segmentation model using a modified k
means algorithm that would classify patients into buckets based on their
behavior characteristics to segment customers for pharma major; HIVE,
Pyspark, Python – sklearn, pandas, seaborn
Social Media Analytics (Text Classification)
Built a classification algorithm to gauge public sentiment and created a
customized dashboard to analyse key themes trending about traveller
programs and its products; Python – pandas, sklearn, 
NLTK, spacy, gensim
Text Analytics on Customer Conversations
Built a text classification model that learns from the language usage and the
contexts can be used to tag the conversations with predefined topics was
built on transcribed conversation notes. An unsupervised technique that
creates word vectors (word embedding) was used to determine correlated

keywords from conversations. These keywords were used to generate labels
for predefined topics. An array of supervised classification models were built
to learn from this label dataset and use an ensemble approach to accurately
classify any new conversations into the topic buckets. Python – pandas,
sklearn, NLTK, spacy, gensim
