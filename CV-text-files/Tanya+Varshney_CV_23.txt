Message from the Designer
Hi, I'm Tanya Varshney, an experienced 
graphic designer with a passion for creating 
beautiful and functional designs. I specialize in 
UI/UX design and am looking for new 
opportunities to showcase my skills.
With about 3+ years of experience in the 
design industry, I have developed a strong 
understanding of the principles of design, 
including typography, color theory, layout, and 
composition. I have a deep understanding of 
user-centered design principles and how to 
create interfaces that are both visually 
appealing and easy to use.
My skills include creating wireframes and 
prototypes, conducting user research, and 
collaborating with developers to bring designs 
to life. I am always looking for new challenges 
and opportunities to learn and grow as a 
designer.
If you're looking for a creative and passionate 
designer with expertise in UI/UX design, I 
would love to connect with you. Let's work 
together to create beautiful and effective 
designs that meet the needs of your users.
