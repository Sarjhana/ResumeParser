Summary
Hello! . I'm a dedicated Data Science enthusiast with a profound
passion for leveraging data analytics and statistics to drive
meaningful insights and enable data-driven decision-making. 
Having recently graduated from Malla Reddy Engineering
College (MREC) in Hyderabad, I had the privilege of receiving
a comprehensive education that has equipped me with a strong
academic foundation. Throughout my studies, I maintained an
exceptional academic record, graduating with an impressive
aggregate of 87%. 
During my academic journey, I actively refined my communication
skills, recognizing the importance of effectively conveying complex
technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders. I firmly believe
that data storytelling is an integral part of the analytics process. To
this end, I have developed expertise in creating compelling business
intelligence dashboards using tools such as Microsoft Power BI and
Excel. By combining data visualization techniques with insightful
analysis, I ensure that data tells a compelling story that resonates
with the audience. 
I possess a robust skill set in data preprocessing and analysis, which
enables me to extract valuable insights and generate informative
business reports. Proficient in tools like Power BI and Tableau, I am
adept at transforming raw data into meaningful visualizations that
facilitate data-driven decision-making. Moreover, I have extensive
experience working with MySQL and other relational databases,
ensuring efficient data management and retrieval. 
My proficiency extends to the utilization of Python libraries such
as Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and
Seaborn. These powerful tools have allowed me to develop machine

learning models and perform in-depth data analysis. I believe in the
significance of continuous learning and professional development,
as evidenced by my acquisition of 15+ verified badges from IBM and
75+ licenses and certifications. 
As an advocate of learning in public, I regularly share my
experiences and knowledge with others. I embrace the opportunity to
connect and collaborate with like-minded individuals, as I believe that
knowledge grows when shared. Please feel free to follow/connect
with me to benefit from my insights and experiences. 
Thank you for visiting my LinkedIn profile, and I look forward to
engaging with you and exploring potential opportunities in the
exciting world of data science!
