INTRODUCTION 
I am a filmmaker who has experience in working in almost all the technical departments involved in 
Filmmaking. I believe it is important for a Filmmaker to understand the possibilities, limitations, 
workflows, ins and outs of every department as filmmaking is a collaborative art. I can add a lot of 
value as a video producer with my work experience and knowledge in every department and take a 
 lot of learning back and enrich my experience.
