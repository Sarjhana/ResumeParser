OBJECTIVE
Basically I believe more in the �sions rather than just thinking, I can work more smarter when there is no hope
for the outcome, have evenly trained myself for the workload and e�ective work delivery. My ultimate target is
to deliver the perfection from my work. If the company understands my work spirit it would be best for me to
give my best for the organization.
I have been attached with motorcycles since my childhood and now it is my passion to be around the
motorcycles
