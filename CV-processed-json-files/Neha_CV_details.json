A rule-based method is\ncompared with several machine learning approaches. Gestures and\nspeech signals are initially classi\ufb01ed using hidden Markov models,\nreaching accuracies of 89.6 percent and 84 percent respectively.

Principal contributions of the paper are: wavelet descriptor has\nbeen applied to extracting moment invariant shape future of hand\ngestures and possibility theory (PT) has been used for classi\ufb01cation of\ngestures. Preprocessing and extraction of overlapping frames (start\nand end point of each gesture) are the other major events which have\nbeen solved using background modeling and novel gradient method.\nWe have shown that the overlapping frames are helpful for fragment-\ning a continuous ISL gesture into isolated gestures. These isolated\ngestures are further processed and classi\ufb01ed. During the segmenta-\ntion process some of the geometrical features like shape and orien-\ntation of hand are deformed, which has been overcome by extracting\na new moment invariant feature through wavelet descriptor. These\nfeatures are then combined with the other two features (orienta-\ntion and speed) and are classi\ufb01ed using PT. Here we use PT in place\nof probability theory because possibility deals with the problem of\nuncertainty and impression whereas probability handles only uncer-\ntainty issues. Experiments have been performed on 20 sentences of\ncontinuous ISL gestures having 4000 samples where each sentence\nhaving 20 instances.

We applied ResNet-50 and CNN+LSTM to\nclassify images. Total 50000 images was used where 60 percent is\nused for training and 30 percent was used for validation and 10 per-\ncent was used for testing. Window based smoothing was used as\npostprocessing to get a better result. To handle the datadrift prob-\nlem we trained the model using semi supervised learning approach.\n25th International Conference on Methods\nand Models in Automation and Robotics\n 24th Aug 2019\n Mi\u0119dzyzdroje, Poland\nOccasion: Presented conference paper in\nMMAR 2019.\nDeep Learning\n3-Day workshop at LIRMM, Montpellier\nUniversity, France\n 22nd July-24 July 2021\n Montpellier, France\nOccasion: Organized 3-day workshop on\ndeep learning.\nUnderstandable human-robot inter-\naction\nComputing science department, Umea Uni-\nversity\n 18th June 2019\n Umea, Sweden\nOccasion: Poster presentation in 31st Swedish\nAI Society Workshop.\nRobotic Manipulator and sketch draw-\ning\nWASP-Wallenberg Foundation\n 11th April 2018\n Stockholm, Sweden\nOccasion: Presented live demo in AI4X- Col-\nlecting Ideas and Identifying Challenges for\nFuture AI Research in Sweden.\nRobotics\nDepartment of Electronics and CSE SUIIT,\nSambalpur University, Burla, Odisha, India\n 30th April 2021\n Sambalpur, India\nOccasion: Delivered talk in International\nworkshop on recent advancements in elec-\ntronica and computer advancement.\nDeep Learning\nLIRMM, Montpellier University, France\n 28th June 2021\n Montpellier, France\nOccasion: Delivered talk at MIC DAY orga-\nnized by Microelectronics department.\nArti\ufb01cial Intelligence and the Future\nof Robotics\nCentre for Arti\ufb01cial Intelligence, Banasthali\nUniversity, Rajasthan, India\n 22nd March 2021\n Rajasthan, India\nOccasion: Delivered talk at Faculty Develop-\nment Programme on Arti\ufb01cial Intelligence,\nRobotics, and Automation.\nTechniques: Vgg-16, ResNet-50, CNN+LSTM\nPlatform: Python, TensorFlow, Keras.\nScene change detection\nKaliber Labs\nWe are given an endoscopy videos, our task is to identify changes on\nthe basis of tool and anatomy.
