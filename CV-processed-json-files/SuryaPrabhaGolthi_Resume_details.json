The\nvarious structural elements of multi-storey building need to be designed taking the strength and\nstability factors into consideration. The building was designed by considering dead load and live\nload according to standards and by considering seismic force to ensure the safety and keeping\ncareful balance between economy and safety. Structural members of the project analyzed and\ndesigned by using the software\u2019s like STAAD.Pro and E-Tabs. The building should sustain all the\nloads and deformation of normal construction and have adequate desirability and resistance to\nthe effects of seismic force.\nINDUSTRIAL VISITS",
