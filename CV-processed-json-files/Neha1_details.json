This API can be used to\nextract text from images and PDF s more affordably\n\uf06c\nI refactored the code to optimize for faster execution. By\nstreamlining the code and removing unnecessary steps, we\nwere able to significantly reduce processing times and\nimprove the overall efficiency of the application.\n\uf06c\nI highlighted the disease names that were extracted from\nthe PDFs. By using an algorithm to identify disease-related\nterms, we were able to automatically highlight relevant\ninformation and make it easier for researchers to quickly\nscan through the documents.\n\uf06c\n\"I scraped valuable data that can\nbe used by the data team for\nfuture analysis and decision-\nmaking.\"\nMovies Collections Services(Django,\nFlask,ORM,REST API)\n\uf06c\nIntegrate with movies listing API\n\uf06c\nImplement APIs for movies\ncollection Applications\n\uf06c\nImplement a request counter\nmiddleware\nBlog Post Application(Django,\nFlask,ORM,REST API)\n\uf06c\nCreate three tables in Data Base\nUser,Post/Blog,Like\n\uf06c\nCRUD for all three tables\n\uf06c\nGET all post/blog API also return\nthe number of likes of\nevery post/blog\nOmfys Technology Pune - Python Developer\nSep 2021 \u2013 Mar 2022\n\uf06c\nI worked on a project that involved web scraping using\nSelenium WebDriver, Python, and Beautiful Soup. My\nresponsibilities included setting up the scraping process,\nanalyzing the data, and presenting the findings to the team.\n\uf06c\nMy goal is to write code that is reusable, testable, and\nefficient, which can improve the quality of our software and\nreduce development time.\n\uf06c\nI contributed to a Django application by working with\nDjango ORM and MVT (Model-View-Template) architecture.\nMy responsibilities included designing database models,\ncreating views, and integrating templates to deliver a\nrobust, scalable web application.\n\uf06c\nI have experience with Python automation, including\nscripting and process automation. By leveraging Python's\npowerful libraries and frameworks, I have been able to\nstreamline tasks, increase efficiency, and reduce errors."
