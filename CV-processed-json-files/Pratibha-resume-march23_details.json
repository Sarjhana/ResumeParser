We developed semi-\nsupervised Data Mining methods using less/moderate size annotated data and proposed Context Based \nList (CBL) concept that groups items of some specific context. Using this concept, we developed novel \nassociative context classification method and used it for part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging) and word \nsense disambiguation (WSD) NLP tasks. Python was used for implementing the thesis work. \nMS THESIS \nTitle: Novel Bayesian Sequence Classifiers Applied on Biological Sequences \nAdviser: Dr. Vikram Pudi \nIn this thesis we studied the biological data analysis problem of predicting the family of a newly \ndiscovered sequence and presented two data mining based generic solutions: RBNBC and REBMEC. \nThese supervised classifiers did not use domain knowledge but performed comparable to the existing \nprobabilistic bio-sequence classifiers and can be applied to other domains. Thesis tasks were \nimplemented in Perl language. \nADVANCED COURSES TAKEN \n\u25cf Data Warehousing & Data Mining, Web Data & Knowledge Management, \n\u25cf Information Retrieval & Extraction, Cloud Computing, Data Compression \n\u25cf Pattern Recognition, Machine Learning, Artificial Neural Networks \n\u25cf Coursera Deep Learning Specialization courses on Convolutional Neural Networks \n\u25cf Coursera Deep Learning Specialization courses on Sequence Models \n\u25cf Python for Data Science, AI & Development course of Coursera \n\u25cf Git Essential Training course on LinkedIn Learning \n\u25cf Advanced AI: Transformers for Computer Vision course on LinkedIn Learning \n\u25cf Natural Language Processing with PyTorch course on LinkedIn Learning \n\u25cf TensorFlow: working with NLP course on LinkedIn Learning \nOTHER ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENTS \n4 \n\u25cf Participated and volunteered in organizing BDA 2017 conference at IIIT Hyderabad. \n\u25cf Presented research papers in COMAD 2008, DSAA 2014 and ICON 2017 conferences. \n\u25cf Attended COMAD 2006, PAKDD 2010, ICON 2014 and VLDB 2016 conferences. \n\u25cf Conducted workshop on Data Mining for final year BTech (CSE) students in SVIT College, \nSecunderabad on 28 October 2016. \n\u25cf Received travel and registration grant from VLDB\u201916 conference organizing committee for attending \nVLDB'16 conference at Delhi, India in September 2016. \n\u25cf Received Google Travel Grant of RS 90,000 in September 2014 to present paper in DSAA\u201914 \nconference in Shanghai, China. \n\u25cf Participated in R&D showcase 2008-2010 and 2015-2019 at IIIT Hyderabad. \nRanked 1st among girls in the state in 10th board exam. \nPUBLICATIONS \n1.
