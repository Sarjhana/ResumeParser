(data.gov.in)\n- The analysis had to be done to find the dependent factors which influence the\noverall rating, food rating and service rating of the restaurant. \n- Predictive analysis needs to be applied to find response of customer in a\ndifferent scenario. \n- In the pre-processing of the dataset, qualitative information was converted\nto quantitative data; including data cleaning.The dataset was converted into\nmultiple table using the database approach- entity relationship diagram.\n- Supervised learning methods of correlation, linear regression and\nANOVA was done. Later, unsupervised learning method was also applied.\nUnsupervised learning does not use previously known results to train its\nmodels. Rather, it uses descriptive statistics to examine the natural patterns\nand relationships that occur within the data and does not predict a target\nvalue. \n- Another data set of Mutual Fund Performance for 8 years was collected.\n- The growth rates of the mutual fund are influenced by various factors, which\nare mostly indirect, like the technological development in industries, industrial\ngrowth, gross profit margin in the industry etc. in which the mutual fund\ncompany has invested its bonds. For the customer to buy a mutual fund bond,\nthe Net Value of the bond should be high, so as the person who is investing\ngets higher returns.\n- For the purpose, predictive and time series analysis was applied for model\ngeneration.\nEY\nSocial Media/Business Analyst Intern\nJanuary 2015\u00a0-\u00a0August 2015\u00a0(8 months)\nVirtual\nThe company hired me for social media and business analytics- highly\nconfidential.\n- The dataset was entirely generated by extracting information from the Twitter\nprofile of the clients for whom the analytics was performed.
