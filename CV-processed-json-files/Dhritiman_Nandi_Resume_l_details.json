Then we \nestimated the market share and calculated the difference \nwith the market share derived from the data. Then we \nmodeled it as an non-linear minimization problem and used \nGMM to solve the same with iterations until the difference \nreached a pre-defined tolerance value. We also checked \ngradient descent algorithm as another approach to solve the \nminimization problem. \nAlgorithms/Techniques: GMM, Gradient Descent \nalgorithm, 2SLS regression, IV model. \nDuration: Jan 2018-Jun 2018 \n \nOrganization Name: IL&FS Education and Technology \nServices Limited. \nTitle: Investment sensitization using statistical data \nanalysis. \nBusiness Problem: The investors of the organization were \ninterested to know about how to draw statistical inference \non whether company's presence is having any impact in \nhuman life in comparison to the respective district's same \nparameters as benchmark at a reasonably small geography \n(Pin code level in this case). \nApproach: We first came up with a metric to measure the \nsocio-economic condition for an individual and an area (at \nthe pincode level). Then test on population proportion was \nused to test the hypothesis whether the value of the \nmeasure of socio economic condition is higher than the \ndistrict level mean. This method was chosen after careful \nconsideration of other tests as well as non-parametric \nmethods. The sampling distribution was found to follow \nnormal distribution which was in line with using of \nproportionality test. \nAlgorithms/Techniques: Proportionality test, MLR. \nDuration: May 2017-Jul 2017",
