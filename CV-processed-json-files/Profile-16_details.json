I am a self-proclaimed film buff, who loves to crochet,\ncosplay and play 8-ball pool.  \nWHAT DO I DO? \nCurrently, I host and produce a weekly podcast titled \"This week in\nMaldives\" for the news portal known as Rashu.mv. I also work part-\ntime as a videographer for Southpaw Malaysia - a Youtube channel\ncovering the local MMA scene in Malaysia. \nPrior to arriving in Malaysia for my studies, I joined Raajje TV as\na junior video journalist in the English News department; Later, I\nbecame a news anchor for the local news in English. During my time\nat the TV station, I learnt how to create news content under pressure\nbut I also realised my true passion lies specifically in creative story-\ntelling, whichever form it may take. \nWHAT YOU REALLY NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ME. I AM:\n1) A HARD WORKER - I have made good use of every semester\nbreak since I arrived in the country, taking every opportunity that\ncame my way to work in this field from copywriting to online content\ncreation.\n2) A PEOPLE-PERSON - To get a story, I have to talk to lots\nof people. I also enjoy making people laugh and feel fulfilled by\nvolunteer work. After high school, I joined the local Rotaract Club\nwhere I organised fundraisers and community service events such\n\u00a0\nPage 1 of 3\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nas weekly beach cleanups. During my time there, I served one term\neach as Treasurer and Secretary. \n3) CREATIVE - On a semester break, I interned in the pre-production\nand production phase of the Malaysian TV series \"Murder By\nMoonlight\". Working under the art & costume department, I had to\nimprovise with the tools and materials provided and create props\nwithin a time limit. Never had I been happier and more excited to\nhear the words \"figure it out yourself\"\n4) FAST-LEARNER: When I began most of my various jobs, I often\ndid not have relevant"
