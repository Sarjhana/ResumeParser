The application is a desktop-based application and is\nimplemented using Swing and AWT. The project is developed in Java SE language and executed on a single stand-alone\njava across a network using the Loopback address concept.\n  It is a Desktop Based chatting application with the help of Java Swing to make the frame, Socket programming to\ntransfer messages from server and Client.\n  I tried to make frame, looks, working similar to whatsApp chatting window.\nWorkshops/Projects(Electrical)\nUAV(Hexacopter DRONE) | Multi-Rotor,APM 2.8 flight Controller, autopilot Software\nGD : Link\n  Weight-3.5kg, Rotor-8, Endurance-25min, Payload-2kg.\n  Sensors: Gyroscopes, Magnetometers, Accelerometer, GPS, Barometer Pressure Sensor, Compass, Lidar\n  Tasks with limited budgets, time and large area coverage with hard-to-reach places having difficult terrains can be\ncounter easily with UN-Manned Aerial Vehicles remote access control and safety of a pilot onboard.\nAUTO CAD ELECTRICAL | Indo Danish Tool Room(MSME), Jamshedpur\nCertificate : Link\n  Electrical computer-aided design (ECAD) software systems are used to design and develop electronic systems such as\nprinted circuit boards (PCBs) and integrated circuits (ICs).\n  ECAD software enables electrical engineers to create as well as modify diagrams and layouts including 2D and 3D\nmodels.",
