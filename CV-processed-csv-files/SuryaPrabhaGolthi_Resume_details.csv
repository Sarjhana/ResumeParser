The\nvarious structural elements of multi-storey building need to be designed taking the strength and\nstability factors into consideration. The building was designed by considering dead load and live\nload according to standards and by considering seismic force to ensure the safety and keeping\ncareful balance between economy and safety. Structural members of the project analyzed and\ndesigned by using the software's like STAAD.Pro and E-Tabs. The building should sustain all the\nloads and deformation of normal construction and have adequate desirability and resistance to\nthe effects of seismic force.\nINDUSTRIAL VISITS\n \nAn Industrial Visit to ceramic tiles factory near Mandavilli in 2015.\n \nA visit to the multi-purpose National project “Polavaram Project” on the Godavari River in\nthe West Godavari District and East Godavari District in Andhra Pradesh.\n \nVisited multiple paper industries in Andhra Pradesh.\n \nSpecifically, I have a good knowledge in Effluent treatment plants in paper industries.\nACHIEVEMENTS & PARTICIPATIONS\n \nStudent Coordinator for “MEDHA MILAN” (National Student Symposium for Women) at\nSVECW 2017.\n \nVolunteered for “Vishnu E-Moto Championship” at SVECW 2016.\n \nParticipated in the event “WEALTH FROM WASTE” conducted by Eco friendly association at\nSVECW.\n \nWon in the event “Quiz” & “EXTEMPORE” conducted by ISTE STUDENT CHAPTER at SVECW.\n \nParticipated in the event “INTERSTELLAR” conducted by Amateur Astronomy Association” at SVECW.\n \nSkilled in Basics of Music and Dance.\nLANGUAGES KNOWN\n \nEnglish, Telugu, Hindi""]}]",,https://www.linkedin.com/in/prabha2997,,,,"Reading books
