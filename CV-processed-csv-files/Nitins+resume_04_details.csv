  MERN stack E-commerce application        
I have created an Ecommerce website using MERN Stack, which is scalable and future-proof.
I utilized React for the frontend & Redux for state management, while Node JS & Express
were used for the backend with MongoDB as the database. Users are able to add items to
their cart, and the cart system works similarly to that of the Flipkart website.
