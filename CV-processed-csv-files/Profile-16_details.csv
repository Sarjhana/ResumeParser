Summary
WHO AM I?
Born and bred in the tiny island nation of Maldives, I moved to the
big city of Kuala Lumpur in 2021 in order to pursue my passion for all
things creative. I am a self-proclaimed film buff, who loves to crochet,
cosplay and play 8-ball pool.  
WHAT DO I DO? 
Currently, I host and produce a weekly podcast titled ""This week in
Maldives"" for the news portal known as Rashu.mv. I also work part-
time as a videographer for Southpaw Malaysia - a Youtube channel
covering the local MMA scene in Malaysia. 
Prior to arriving in Malaysia for my studies, I joined Raajje TV as
a junior video journalist in the English News department; Later, I
became a news anchor for the local news in English. During my time
at the TV station, I learnt how to create news content under pressure
but I also realised my true passion lies specifically in creative story-
telling, whichever form it may take. 
WHAT YOU REALLY NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ME. I AM:
1) A HARD WORKER - I have made good use of every semester
break since I arrived in the country, taking every opportunity that
came my way to work in this field from copywriting to online content
creation.
2) A PEOPLE-PERSON - To get a story, I have to talk to lots
of people. I also enjoy making people laugh and feel fulfilled by
volunteer work. After high school, I joined the local Rotaract Club
where I organised fundraisers and community service events such

as weekly beach cleanups. During my time there, I served one term
each as Treasurer and Secretary. 
3) CREATIVE - On a semester break, I interned in the pre-production
and production phase of the Malaysian TV series ""Murder By
Moonlight"". Working under the art & costume department, I had to
improvise with the tools and materials provided and create props
within a time limit. Never had I been happier and more excited to
hear the words ""figure it out yourself""
4) FAST-LEARNER: When I began most of my various jobs, I often
did not have relevant"
