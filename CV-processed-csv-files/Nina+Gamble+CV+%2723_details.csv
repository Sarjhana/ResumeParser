I have a strong interest in current affairs. I am also interested in the role
that social media and the media plays in modern life. Within my work I have
focus on queer culture, feminist issues and fashion. This focus takes the form
of the experimental genre, however I have also branched into documentary. Having
worked in retail and customer based roles since the age of 16 I have a
disciplined work ethic, working both independently and within a group setting."
